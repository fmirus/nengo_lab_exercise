    "For this assignment, the goal is to implement a simple accumulator model.  That is, we need a system that will decide which one of two actions it should perform, and it will take some time to do so.  It will make this choice based on a single input value, which gives some evidence as to which choice should be made.  It will indicate a choice by outputting either a 1 or a -1.  If that input evidence is positive, it will be more likely to make the first choice (1), and if the input evidence is negative it will be more likely to make the second choice (-1)."

    "We now start by building a recurrent system that can add up evidence over time (the accumulator).  This is a neural ```Ensemble``` that holds a single dimension, and uses a small number of neurons (50).  Provide it with one input ```Node``` that has a constant value of ```[0.1]``` and connect that input into the ```Ensemble```.  Now make a ```Connection``` from the ```Ensemble``` back to itself.  Since this ```Connection``` is accumulating evidence over time, we want it to be fairly stable, so set ```synape=0.1``` on this ```Connection```.  This means that the neurotransmitter being used will spread out over 100ms, rather than the default 5ms.\n",

    "Next, we need to make the accumulator more random.  In a standard accumulator model, there is a \"random-walk\" component that randomly varies the value being accumulated.  We can model this by adding random noise into the ```Ensemble```.  The command for this is:\n",

    "Finally, we want to determine when this accumulator passes some threshold.  If the value becomes large enough, we should make one choice (+1), and if it becomes small enough we should make the other choice (-1).
